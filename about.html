<pre>Hello!
I go by Dominic. I am a student in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp for Web Development. This website will be updated
as I create more projects. If you would like to see what I have worked on, you can click <a href="portfolio.html">here.</a>
The past three years I have been a medical coder, but after seeing that coding can be automated, I decided I 
need to go back to school and go for a different skill set.
