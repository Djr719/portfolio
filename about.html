<p>Hello!

My name is Dominic, and I am a student at Rutgers. I am taking the coding bootcamp for Web 
Development. My Myers-Briggs personality test came back with INFP. 

This website will be updated as I create more projects. If 
you would like to see what I have worked on, you can click <a href="portfolio.html">here.</a>

The past three years I have been a medical coder. I thought that this course could help me to learn
how to automate certain tasks, and make medical coding and billing more efficient. I also found out that medical coding
is becoming automated, and I thought now would be a good time to learn a new skill set. </p>
