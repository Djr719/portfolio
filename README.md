For this challenge, we needed to create a website that show cased our portfolio. It was complete when the following 
acceptance criteria was met:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

When the website was deployed the following criteria needed to be met:

Application deployed at live URL.
Application loads with no errors.
Application GitHub URL submitted.
GitHub repository contains application code.

The repository also needed to meet the following criteria:

Repository has a unique name.
Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions.
Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.
Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages.
Repository contains quality readme with description, screenshot, link to deployed application.

I believe that I satisied most of the requirements. I decided to have links that clicked to other pages since it is going to showcase my portfolio.  I used HTML semantics and tried my best to consolidate the CSS sheets. I was unable to get the HTML files under the HTML folder to link back to the first CSS sheet, so I created a second one. I also added custom font, so I added it to my 'Assets' folder.
