<p>For my first project I collaborated with a team to create a website. It 
 combined everything we have learned which included JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
 
 The premise of the site was for people to be able to look up movies with low
 ratings, so they can laugh at how poorly made the movies were. We used two APIs
 to bring together movies with low ratings. Users would be able to save the
 movies they wanted to watch on a "watchlist." We were unable to get the watchlist
 to show up on the screen. We will need to make corrections in the future.
